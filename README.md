<!-- TECHNOLOGY USED -->

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technology Used

The Crust & Craft Application is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its component-based architecture and efficient state management.

  - **React Router**: React Router is a library for managing routing in React applications. It enables developers to define and handle different routes within a single-page application (SPA), allowing for navigation between different views or components based on the URL.

  - **React Redux**: React Redux is a library that integrates the Redux state management tool with React applications. Redux helps manage application state in a predictable and centralized manner, making it easier to maintain and debug complex applications. React Redux provides bindings to connect React components to the Redux store, enabling seamless integration of Redux with React.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined utility classes for building responsive and customizable user interfaces directly within HTML markup.

- **Vite**: Vite is a fast build tool for modern web development, emphasizing quick build times and a smooth development experience.
